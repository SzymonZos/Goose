# Goose

Goose is a small utility library which supports inserting STL collection-like
types to the output streams. It also provides stringification of such
collections.

## Supported platforms

Supported C++ standard versions are 17 and 20. Linux and Mac are tested on the
CI. Support for Windows is not guaranteed.

## Usage

1. Goose can be used as single header library from the release version.
2. Another way of using Goose is to add this repo as a submodule. Currently,
   only CMake is supported as a build system.
